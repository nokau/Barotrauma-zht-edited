## What is this?
This is an unofficial Traditional Chinese localization mod for the game Barotrauma, based on the official ones.
Their lines are matched as close as possible with the game's current version English text files for easier side-by-side comparison.

Do use it at your own risk, as I couldn't guarantee any of the translations were as accurate as possible whatsoever, but feel free to edit it on your own. And always back up your edited files.

## Recommended Tools:
- Notepad++

## For now this project focuses more on these elements:
- Names of the interactable items and devices
- Main menu UI
- Gameplay UI
- Partial Submarine Editor UI
- In-game interactable devices, items
- Events and missions
- NPC Conversations

## Notes:
- I left most of the character, location names within missions and events un-translated since all the generated names are not translated either.
- I left these ship names un-translated: Bunyip, Muikku, Selkie, Kastrull, Herja.
- Very different translated names for some of the items and devices.

## The files:
You can find the mentioned files inside the [current_version](./current_version) folder:
### NpcConversations_TraditionalChinese.xml
- This file contains translated lines of NPC conversations.
- The game's file is located at ```Steam\steamapps\common\Barotrauma\Content\NPCConversations\TraditionalChinese```

### TraditionalChineseVanilla.xml
- This file contains translated lines of all the English files found within the game's Texts folder, because using seperated files doesn't seem to work.
- The game's file is located at ```Steam\steamapps\common\Barotrauma\Content\Texts\TraditionalChinese```
- If you were interested in editing side-by-side with the English flies, I'd recommend using these files instead, then combine them into TraditionalChineseVanilla.xml afterward:
  - **TCVanilla.xml**
  - **TCVanillaEditorTexts.xml**
  - **TCVanillaNew.xml**
