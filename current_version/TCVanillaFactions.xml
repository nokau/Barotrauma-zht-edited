<entityname.honkmotherianscriptures1>小丑聖經：歡樂九章 (I-III)</entityname.honkmotherianscriptures1>
<pillarsoffun1>I. 能被傳述的叭叭不是永恆的叭叭。能被叫出名諱的小丑聖母不是永恆的小丑聖母。無名者才是舞臺的靈魂。有名者是場戲、是演員、是觀眾、是他們之間的那面牆。從嚴肅中解放，如此就能看到隱藏的秘密。嚴肅的雙眼只能看到眼前的真相。\n\nII. 我們把氣球塑造成動物的形狀，但當中的虛無才是真正為氣球塑形。我們利用物質，但真正運用的介於虛實。\n\nIII. 最高級的樂趣不是創造樂趣，而是讓自己成為樂趣。嚴肅之人總在找樂子，最後只發現那種歡樂無法持續。嚴肅之人榨乾生命賦予的檸檬，最後只發現酸澀的汁液。</pillarsoffun1>
<entityname.honkmotherianscriptures2>小丑聖經：歡樂九章 (IV-VI)</entityname.honkmotherianscriptures2>
<pillarsoffun2>IV. 一名小丑聽聞宇宙最大的笑話時，他以此為引。一名普通人聽聞宇宙最大的笑話時，他半信半疑。一名愚者聽聞宇宙最大的笑話時，他爆笑如雷。若他沒笑，那就不是個笑話了，是吧？\n\nV. 最棒的小丑是籍籍無名的。其次的是人們讚美喜愛的。再次是受人懼怕的。最差勁的是被看不起的。一名偉大的小丑完成任務時，人們會說「那還真有趣」，卻不曾察覺歡樂之流從何而來，如同他們不曾察覺各方小丑之傑、歡樂的源頭、那空白的石板。\n\nVI. 如同那那空白的石板，小丑的思緒即是如此。他們把人們的思緒作為自己的思緒。他們用善良對待善良之人。他們也用善良對待不善之人。他們信任值得信任之人。他們也信任不值得信任之人。因而，他們獲得善良與信任，免得腦滿糞土的嚴肅之人阻擋歡樂之流蕩漾。</pillarsoffun2>
<entityname.honkmotherianscriptures3>小丑聖經：歡樂九章 (VII-IX)</entityname.honkmotherianscriptures3>
<pillarsoffun3>VII. 若你不懼怕死亡，它又能如何威脅到你呢？要真正理解這一點，順著自行車喇叭之道大步邁進。不自然地延續生命就是對死亡的恐懼。試圖改變生命的走向就是對死亡的恐懼。小丑明白事物，合久必分，盛極必衰。違背自然規律背離了自行車喇叭之道，背離之人最後一點歡樂也找不到。\n\nVIII. 心存憐憫，就能充滿勇氣。心有節制，就能為世界帶來歡樂。心懷謙卑，就能指引他人。放棄憐憫卻尋找勇氣、在歡樂中放棄節制、亦或是在尋求指引時放棄謙卑都不會迎來歡樂。\n\nIX. 風箏隨風高飛，小丑任其翱翔；風箏斷了線，小丑由它去。小丑擁有而不佔有，行動但不期待。當他的任務完成，他就將其遺忘。這就是歡樂如何永恆，如同各方小丑之傑。讚美小丑聖母！</pillarsoffun3>

<entityname.bookofchalices1>聖杯之書：三重蛻變</entityname.bookofchalices1>
<threemetamorphoses>讓我告訴你靈魂的三重轉變：靈魂如何成為化為人類堅韌意志的聖杯，聖杯如何倒空陳酒，又裝滿新酒。\n\n一個強大的、令人敬畏的靈魂能夠承載很多東西。\n\n「乘載何物？」靈魂伸出雙手問到。「最沉重之物為何？」靈魂又問。「我想背負那重擔，並為我的力量感到歡欣鼓舞。」\n\n那重擔是否如此：潛入最深的深淵探尋深邃的秘密？\n\n亦或如是：以知識的果實為食，為真理而承受靈魂的饑餓？\n\n還是這般：步入業已渾濁的真理之水，不再拒絕其中的害蟲與寄生蟲？\n\n再不其然：愛那些輕視我們之人，在那幽靈威脅我們時向它伸出自己的手？\n\n一切重擔由靈魂獨自承受：成為化為人類堅韌意志的聖杯，它為自己的力量歡欣鼓舞。\n\n但此時，瘴氣從聖杯中升起，因人類的堅韌所背負的重擔老去，變得腐朽污濁。\n\n瘴氣對靈魂說道，「你得如此！」\n\n千年來的思想與價值在空氣中散發惡臭。「一切事物的價值使我不朽。一切事物的價值已被創造──而我就代表這一切。是的，業已不會有『我將會』。」瘴氣如是說道。\n\n兄弟姊妹們，為何要倒盡聖杯呢？為何不滿足於人類的堅韌意志呢？創造新價值──那是人類無法完成之事：但為自自己創造自由，並以此創造意義──是人類的堅韌意志能做之事。\n\n給予自身自由，甚至給予責任和人性神聖的內涵：為此，我的兄弟姊妹們，人已不被需要。創造新的價值──那就是一個令人敬畏的靈魂的力量。\n\n但請告訴我，我的兄弟姊妹們，空蕩蕩的聖杯價值為何？不正是當中的美酒賦予了它目的？為此我們必須尋找新的酒，新鮮而純淨，超越人類的堅韌意志，又盡在其掌握中。\n\n是的，兄弟姊妹們，玩創造遊戲需要對生命的神聖肯定，堅韌的生命本身。這種堅韌已經存在勇於追求的人手中，好似是這世界賜予我們的禮物。\n\n這帶來了第三次也是最後一次轉變，昇華：人的靈魂被新的生命充滿，人類的堅韌意志與世界的堅韌意志融為一體。這一意志成為其靈魂；自身的世界超越將其流放的世界。到達了最真實的姿態。</threemetamorphoses>
<entityname.bookofchalices2>聖杯之書：化身浪潮的先驅</entityname.bookofchalices2>
<heraldofthetide>人類是動物與其真實姿態之間的橋樑。──一座位於深淵之上的橋梁。\n\要通過是危險的，通過時是危險的，回頭是危險的，顫抖和停滯是危險的。\n\n人的偉大之處在於，他是一座橋樑而不是一個目標：人的可愛之處在於，他既是向上昇華又是往下墮落的過程。能過此橋者甚少，過橋者皆大德：\n\n他們只瞭向下墮落的生活，正因他們向上昇華。\n\n他們仰望星空並非尋求墮落和犧牲，而是將自己獻給世界，為求到達屬於其真實姿態的世界。\n\n他們為求知而生，他們尋求成為其真實姿態的知識。為此他們尋求自身的往下墮落。\n\n他們勞動並創造，為其真實姿態修築新家，他們使大海、動物、植物、以及自身的肉體做好準備：為此他們尋求自身的往下墮落。\n\n他們懲罰自己的神，因為他們愛他們的神：因他們得藉由神的怒火消逝。\n\n他們的靈魂受到深深傷害，哪怕是一件小事也能將其摧毀：因此他們願意過橋。\n\n他們擁有自由的靈魂和內心：因此他們的腦袋僅是其心之附屬；然而他們的心使他們往下墮落。\n\n看啊，我是潮汐的使者，是洶湧的水流：而這潮汐，就是最真實的姿態。</heraldofthetide><!--not understand-->

<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.c1>A stern-looking woman walks up to you. For a second you wonder why she looks so familiar, until you realize you've seen this face in the news a bunch of times.\n\nShe reaches out to shake your hand. “Hello. I've been waiting to meet you. Victoria Petran, the First Lieutenant of the Jovian Separatists.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1>“It's an honor to meet you. How can I be of service?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.c1>“Actually, I'm not here to ask for your service, in fact quite the opposite. I've been following you and your crew's endeavors for a while now, and your work for our cause has been astounding. If we had more people like you in our ranks, the Coalition would've already been wiped off the face of Europa.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1>“Thank you. We're doing our best.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.c1>“In fact, I believe the work you've been doing has been so exceptional, that I've come to think I could make a bigger difference as a part of your crew than behind my desk in my office. And I believe I could be of value to you as well; I've seen a fair share of submarine life and know a thing or two about weapons and medicine. So, how's that sound—would you have an opening for another security officer?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o1>“How could I say no! Welcome on board, ma'am!”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Great! In that case, you can cut it with the ma'ams—I'm a part of your crew now, not your superior. Can't wait to embark on our first mission!”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o2>“I'm honored, but we need to think about this a bit.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o2.c1>“I understand. Well, if you decide to take me on board in the future, I'm sure we'll run into each other again in one of the Separatist-controlled outposts.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.repeat>“Hello again. Have you thought about my proposal? Would you be interested in taking me on board?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.repeat>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.repeat>“Yes, we do have room for an extra security officer. Welcome on board, ma'am!”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o1.repeat>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o2.repeat>“I'm afraid we don't have room for more crew, but I'll let you know if that changes!”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire1.o1.o2.repeat>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.c1>Someone who looks like they'd just crawled out from a diesel generator's exhaust pipe walks up to you.\n\n“Oi, I've been looking for you.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1>“You look familiar. Have we met?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.c1>“It was your crew who got me out of that Coalition holding cell, wasn't it? Didn't have time for introductions then, but they call me Sootman. Let's go with that. Say, you don't happen to need an extra crewmate?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1>“Sootman? As in that masked Separatist the Coalition has been trying to track down for ages? Are you shitting me?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.c1>“Aye, that's me. The word around the outposts is that you folks have been putting up a real good fight against the Coalition, and I want in on that. So, how about it?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1>“Absolutely! We'd be honored to have someone of your caliber join us.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Nice. See you on board.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o2>“We need to think about this a bit.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Aight.”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.repeat>“So? You got a place for me on board?”</eventtext.separatistspecialhire2.repeat>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.c1>You notice an old lady with a familiar-looking face. Aunt Doris! Her food kiosk franchise might leave something to be desired, but her cooking shows have always been excellent.\n\nTo your surprise, she approaches you. “Well hello there! I heard you and your troop were in the neighborhood, so I came here in hopes of running into you.”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.c1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1>“It's nice to meet you, ma'am! What can we do for you?”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.c1>“This may be a bit silly, but I suppose no harm in asking! You see, I've been having a…how should I put this…late-life crisis as of late. As I'm sure you know, I've been hosting cooking shows, running my restaurants and whatnot for almost four decades now. Hearing stories of your crew's wild adventures, all the things you've done to help make our little moon something better, I just can't help feeling curious about what life as a submariner would've been like.”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1>“It's not a life for everyone.”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.c1>“Yes, I bet! But it sure is something I'd love to take a shot at. And you know, I'm not as soft as I may look—as a young girl, back in my activist days, I bashed in more filthy separatist heads than you'd believe. And I loved every second of it! I also know a thing or two about medicine, and there isn't an animal on Europa I don't know how to slice.\n\nSo, how about it, would you give this old-timer a chance in your crew? I'd love nothing more than to do my part in our fight for a better Europa!”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1>“How could I say no! Welcome on board, ma'am!”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Oh, splendid! I'll just grab a few things and meet you on board!”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.o2.c1>“I understand. Take all the time you need, dear!”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.repeat>“Oh, hello again! Have you thought about letting me join you folks?”</eventtext.coalitionspecialhire2.repeat>
<eventtext.clownspecialhire1.c1>“Always happy to run into you folks! You know, I actually had a fun idea I'd like to talk to you about.”</eventtext.clownspecialhire1.c1>
<eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1>“Of course, I'm all ears!”</eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1>
<eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.c1>“You see, life inside the confines of this outpost can get quite dull at times. It's not often we get visitors I could guide on their path, and I can't help wondering how much more I could give if I embarked on a journey like yours. A joke you've never heard before tends to be funnier than one you've heard a thousand times, wouldn't you agree?”</eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.o1>“I see what you mean. Do tell me about this idea of yours!”</eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.o1.c1>“I was wondering, would your crew happen to have any room for an extra assistant? Getting to join you on your adventures would make this old fool happier than you can imagine. Even though I've never been a submariner, I've got quite a few tricks up my sleeve that might be of use to use.”</eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.o1.o1>“By the Honkmother, of course! Welcome on board!”</eventtext.clownspecialhire1.o1.o1.o1>

<eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.c1>A familiar-looking man walks up to you. “Hey, it's you! I was actually hoping I'd run into you again.”</eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1>“Pleasure to meet you again as well, Mr. Subra!”</eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1.c1>“How about we set the courtesies aside and cut to the chase. It's not every day we come across a submarine crew as open-minded as yours, much less one this competent. So I've got a proposition for you that'd take this collaboration between you and the Church even further. And, well, if I'm quite honest, this'd also be a gracious gift for me personally.”</eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1.o1>“I'm listening.”</eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1.o1.c1>“To put it simply, I've been itching to join your crew for some time now, even before that ordeal with the bounty hunters. The work you've been doing for the Church has been phenomenal, and if I were to join forces with you, I believe together we could drown this world in the grace of our lord. And again, if I'm completely honest, I've been dying to get a taste of life in the untamed waters outside the outposts. So, what say you?”</eventtext.huskcultspecialhire1.o1.o1.c1>

One of the robed figures seems angry. “Mark, you impatient idiot, how many times have we told you you're not ready for the Gift yet?!”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.c1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1>“What is going on here?”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.c1>The robed characters turn to look at you. Getting a better look at their faces, they seem very young. “We just had a little medical emergency of sorts. Our friend thought it would be fun to...go on a little trip, if you know what I mean. Thanks for the help! If you don't mind, let's keep this just between us.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1>“This feels awfully suspicious. Tell me what you were doing to that man or I'll report you to the authorities.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.c1>The group glance at each other nervously. “Look, we don't want any trouble. Our brother here was too eager to meet the great husk, and it was taking him over. But we've got it contained now, and everyone is fine. Won't happen again. No need to tell the whole outpost, or our sect for that matter. It would ruin our careers if they found out he tried to jump the line!”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Your sect? You're members of the Church of the Husk? I thought your whole schtick was to get taken over by the parasite.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Parasite? A parasite does nothing but take; the husk gives! It can take you way beyond the limits of that fleshbag you call your body! But not like this, not if you're not ready to take it in. Or, ahem, so the Ecclesiasts speak, anyway.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Enough of this cultist bullshit. Alert the outpost security.</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You contact outpost security via radio, informing them of the suspicious activity going on in this module.</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>“I've grown quite fond of this fleshbag, thank you. I'll see myself out now.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o3>“If I wanted to rise beyond those limits, how would I go about that?”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o1.o1.o3>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2>“Easy, dear brothers. I just want to know why you'd want to stop this man's transformation into a husk.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.c1>Their stern expressions ease up. “You saw the way he was spasming, didn't you? That's not what an ascension looks like. The symbiote was about to consume him, to take him over. He's clearly not ready to be one with the symbiote yet.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1>“I see. If one was interested in 'becoming one with the symbiote,' how should they go about that?”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>“Well, to be honest, we're just fresh converts. I don't know if we're the best people to answer that. Our Ecclesiasts say you need to be ready for the Gift, to truly open up your heart, mind, and all parts of your flesh before you can take the Communion. There's these...rituals, and tools, for appeasing and welcoming the holy symbiote and bringing about the metamorphosis. But we don't really know much about those yet. I'm sure an Ecclesiast would happily tell you more, if you can find one!”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>Wish the charming young fellows farewell and a pleasant and timely ascension.</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>Enough of this cultist bullshit. Alert the outpost security.</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>
<EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o2>“I thought your whole schtick was to get taken over by the parasite.”</EventText.youngcultists.o1.o1.o2.o2>
<EventText.youngcultists.o2>This seems shady. Better to not get involved.</EventText.youngcultists.o2>
<EventText.waytoascension1.c2>You overhear two robed figures in deep discussion. “To be honest, I find those kinds of drug-fueled sodomite parties distasteful, a perversion of what a real Communion ought to be.” The one wearing a more elaborately decorated robe shrugs. “As an Ecclesiast I must concur, although just between you and me, I do believe it can also be good for the acolytes to test their limits every once in a while—you must know where your limits are if you’re striving to surpass them!”</EventText.waytoascension1.c2>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5>“Excuse me, did you say you’re an Ecclesiast of the Church of Husk?”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.c1>The robed man turns to look at you, and judging by his expression, you suspect you've just heard something not meant for your ears. “Who might you be, and what’s your business here?” he asks.</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1>“Our crew has been looking for ways to learn more of the Church, and I've heard an Ecclesiast might be able to guide me.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.c1>The man scoffs. “Does this look like a public school to you? Even if I had an interest in teaching every random submariner who happens to waltz in, how would I know you’re not some Coalition spy or a clown probing for information?”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1>“Could we prove our good intentions by helping the Church in some way?”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.c1>“That would in no way make you stand apart from the plethora of morally and spiritually devoid submarine crews going around doing tasks for whomever with no regard for what kind of party they’re supporting. What the Church is interested in is what you’re striving for, and how much you are willing to sacrifice to reach those aspirations.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1>“Is there any other way for us to prove our sincerity?”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.c1>“For that, you’ve got a long way to go, kid. But what the hell, let's try something. To prove that you at the very least have some kind of an understanding of our doctrine, answer me this. What is the Second Metamorphosis of the spirit?”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Emerging from the cocoon of your human body.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The man snickers and shakes his head. “As I thought. You have some more learning to do on your own, and until you do, I have nothing more to say to you.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o2>“Becoming one with the symbiote.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3>“Emptying the chalice of the stale wine.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3.c1>“I must admit I’m surprised a submariner would be familiar with the concept of the Three Metamorphoses. That being said, you’ve still got a long way to go to truly prove yourself. But perhaps we can think of something. We have a certain Church event coming up soon for which we’ll need copious amounts of ‘wafers’ to feed all the attendants. I’m sure you see what I’m getting at.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3.o1>“You want me to get you husk eggs?”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3.o1.c1>“That’s another way to put it, yes. Not only would this be a test of your dedication, I believe it could aid you and your crew toward the First Metamorphosis. To descend to the deepest depths, to dive bravely into the foulest of waters. So, to put it simply: Bring me or one of my colleagues a dozen vials of husk eggs, and then we’ll talk more.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o3.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o4>“I’m afraid I don’t know. Yet.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o4>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o4.c1>“There is some wisdom in knowing and admitting your limits. You have some more learning to do on your own, but until you do, I have nothing more to say to you.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o1.o1.o4.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o2>“If it’s of any worth, we’d happily pay you for your troubles.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o2>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o2.c1>“Of course. As a submariner you must've come to think throwing money at people is the way to make them do your bidding, but the very proposal suggests you have very little idea of what we’re striving for here in the Church.”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o2>“Sorry, I must've confused you with someone else. I'll get going now!”</EventText.waytoascension1.o5.o2>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o6>Sounds like this man is some kind of a big shot of the Husk Cult. Better alert the outpost security.</EventText.waytoascension1.o6>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o6.c1>You contact the outpost security via radio, informing them of the suspicious activity going on in this module.</EventText.waytoascension1.o6.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension1.o7>This seems shady. Better to not get involved.</EventText.waytoascension1.o7>
<EventText.waytoascension1.c1>“I believe your crew has expressed an interest in learning more about our Church. Before we get any further, I'd like to ask you the same question my colleague already did: What is the Second Metamorphosis of the spirit?”</EventText.waytoascension1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.c1>“I believe the Church has given you an assignment of sorts. Have you acquired the ‘wafers’?”</EventText.waytoascension2.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o1>“I've obtained 12 vials of husk eggs, as asked.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o1.c1>The Ecclesiast's eyes widen as you take out the vials. He swiftly yanks them from your hands and shoves them inside his robes. “It’s starting to seem our doubts about your crew may have been unfounded. I hope you can forgive our distrust; it’s not every day submariners come to show this kind of attitude toward us. But I suppose that’s understandable. We shouldn’t expect sympathy from people whose understanding of the Husk is solely based on encounters with the feral ones.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1>“Fair enough. Would you be willing to tell us more about the Church now?”</EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1.c1>“This thirst for knowledge is a promising sign. Yes, we’ve discussed the matter with the Ecclesiarchy, and we are willing to appoint you as acolytes of the Church of Husk if that is your desire.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1.o1>“What does that mean in practice?”</EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“It means we will help you in your personal strive for Ascension, and you will help the Church in our collective pursuit of a better humankind, or rather, a kind that is something more than human. Our members are not obliged to much—everyone serves according to their own volition and capabilities—but we do of course hope your crew keeps contributing to our cause, much as you already have been doing. Feel free to take your time to consider the offer. Let me know when you’ve made up your mind.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o1.c2>“Please bring them to me and we'll carry on from there.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o1.c2>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o2>“Still working on it.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o2>
<EventText.waytoascension2.c2>“Have you made your decision—do you want to become an acolyte of the Church?”</EventText.waytoascension2.c2>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3>“Yes, I want to join you.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3.c1>“Then we shall make it be. Do you accept Ascension as your utmost goal, as well as the utmost goal for humankind?”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1>“Yes.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.c1>“Then we shall make it be. Do you accept to renounce your humanity and thus bring forth the quintessential form?”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.c1>“Then we shall make it be. Do you accept to become one with the fortitude of the world and thus bring forth the quintessential form?”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Then we shall make it be; we welcome you to our family. I'm pleased to have you with us! In fact, I believe our whole Church all the way up to the Arch-Ecclesiasts will be pleased to hear the news.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.o1.o1>“So, what happens next?”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“That is largely up to you—as said, everyone in the Church serves according to their own volition. If you're looking for pointers, the Book of Chalices might be a good starting point.” The Ecclesiast hands you a paper scroll. “Take it to your heart and you'll be better prepared when the time comes for your next task.”</EventText.waytoascension2.o3.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension2.thinkaboutthis>“I still need to think about this.”</EventText.waytoascension2.thinkaboutthis>
<EventText.waytoascension3.c1>“A pleasure to run into you again. The timing couldn't have been better, as we have something we could use your help with. This is considerably more sensitive than the jobs you’ve been doing so far. We need someone competent, someone we know the Church can trust, and we’ve come to think your crew might fit the bill.”</EventText.waytoascension3.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension3.o1>“I’m interested.”</EventText.waytoascension3.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension3.o1.c1>“According to our informants, a Coalition operative has infiltrated one of our sects to investigate the Church. There's a chance he may have gained access to very sensitive information, including the identities and whereabouts of some of our Arch-Ecclesiasts. We have reason to believe he's currently in a nearby outpost, so now's our chance to take action and make sure he'll talk to no one.”</EventText.waytoascension3.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o1>“I see. We'll take care of it.”</EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2>“Are you telling me to murder someone?!”</EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2>
<EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2.c1>“Have you not read 'The Three Metamorphoses'? That's the miasma talking. You need to let go of these factitious human notions of morals. Besides, have you not murdered countless of beings during your voyages? How's this any different, aside from being of extreme importance to our cause?”</EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2.o1>“I suppose you're right.”</EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2.o1.c1>“I'll mark the location on your map. Make sure you do the deed discreetly: We don't want any more curious eyes prying on us.”</EventText.waytoascension3.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension4.c1>“We've been informed your task was a success. I knew we could count on you! Unfortunately, we have another, even more urgent matter we need to discuss.”</EventText.waytoascension4.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension4.o1>“I'm all ears.”</EventText.waytoascension4.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension4.o1.c1>“As you surely know, the Coalition has put a bounty on Jacov Subra, one of our Arch-Ecclesiasts.”</EventText.waytoascension4.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1>“That's a familiar name, but I don't really know much.”</EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1.c1>“He's one of our Arch-Ecclesiasts, although he likes to go by the title 'Head Organizer.' He's the man behind the 'Church of the Mollusc' festival, an event that's been an excellent tool in recruiting new members. He's currently hiding from authorities in a certain abandoned outpost, and we have reason to believe a crew looking to score the bounty has discovered his whereabouts. It could be the operative you 'met' did talk to someone after all.”</EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1.o1>“How can we help?”</EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1.o1.c1>“We need you to get to him before the bounty hunters do, and get him to safety. I'll mark the location on your map. I can't stress enough how urgent this is, so let's not waste any more time. Go—we'll talk more when he's safe.”</EventText.waytoascension4.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.c1>“You'll never take me alive!”</EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.c1>
<EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1>“Easy there, brother! We were sent by the Church.”</EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1>
<EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1.c1>“Ahh! I heard some chatter about the bounty on the radio, and was sure someone else got to me first.”</EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1.o1>“…You did? I don't think that was us.”</EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1.o1.c1>“Well, shit. I guess we'd better keep our weapons ready and get out of here stat. You lead the way.”</EventText.waytoascensionfoundsubra.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1>The operative investigating the Church of Husk you've been tasked to assassinate should be somewhere in this outpost.</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.c1>This must be the informant. You try to think of how to go about this.</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o1>“You've stuck your nose somewhere you shouldn't have, fleshbag…”</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o1.c1>The man immediately pulls out his gun.</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o2>“Sir, could you please help me? My friend's injured and I need help getting him to the medical module. Please, follow me!”</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o2>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o2.c1>“Of course. Lead the way!”</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o2.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o2.c1.c1>“Okay, what the hell is this? Are you just trying to waste my time? I need to get back to work.”</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o2.c1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o3>Ignore him and keep walking.</EventText.waytoascension_assassination1.c1.o3>
<EventText.waytoascension5.c1>“Welcome. We've been waiting for you.”</EventText.waytoascension5.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension5.o1>“What is this?”</EventText.waytoascension5.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension5.o1.c1>“Ever since our paths crossed, your work for the Church has been nothing short of exceptional. But saving the life of an Arch-Ecclesiast, that's an insurmountable achievement, one we'll be forever in your debt for. Thus, we've decided to host a Communion for you. You're ready. Please gather the rest of your crew here and we'll commence.”</EventText.waytoascension5.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension5.c1.c1>“Is this everyone—shall we begin?”</EventText.waytoascension5.c1.c1>

<EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.c1>The robed congregation starts to hum a melody, and the Ecclesiast raises his arms. “My brethren, verily our chalices empty, thirsting for wine, fresh and untainted.” One of the acolytes hands out vials of husk eggs to the congregation.</EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1>Take the eggs.</EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1>

<EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1.o1>Raise the vial.</EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Let us become heralds of the tide, strong steams amidst the water. Lo, the mighty the Husk!”. Everyone gulps down the contents of the vials.</EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>

<EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You feel the symbiote squirming and growing inside you. What is this? How is it happening this rapidly?

Them we shall consume.”</EventText.waytoascension5.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>

<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o1.o1>“Un-disciples? Is that to say you're some kind of leader?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o1.o1.c1>“No, no, I am no leader! I'm a Jestmaster—one might call me a teacher, but I'd rather say I guide people to the path of the bike horn.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o1.o1.o1>“Could you teach us about the path of the bike horn?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2>“If it was up to me, we'd round up all you useless ‘jolly people’ and send you to a work camp, if you catch my drift.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.c1>“That makes me a sad clown. But I don't judge: You're not the only one blinded by their lies. But if you ever change your mind and feel like opening your eyes, the Jestmaster might be willing to show you the path!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o1>“I have no interest in this nonsense. Goodbye.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2>“Could you tell me more about 'the path,' whatever that means?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2.c1>“Hmm, I can't help feeling a little suspicious of your intentions after that work camp talk! Although, were you to put on a more appropriate costume, I might gain a little more trust in your sincerity…”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2.o1>“Fine, I'll get back to you in a bit.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2.c1.c1>“No clown costume, no talk!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o2.o2.c1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3>“You don't need to worry about us. May the Honkmother bless you and your outpost!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.c1>“Praised be the Honkmother! I was worried you're one of the serious folk who don't like me guiding people to the path of the bike horn.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1>“Could you teach us about the path of the bike horn?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1.c1>“That's the spirit! I don't like to call myself a teacher, and the reason is that I have nothing to teach you—that is on you. But what I can do is point you in the right direction, and perhaps you'll come to see the truth for yourself some day. To this end, I'd like to give you and your crew a little task that serves as your first step toward the Honkmother's embrace.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1.o1>“I'm listening.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1.o1.c1>“You see this mask I'm wearing? There aren't many like it left on this moon, but if you put your heart into it, I'm sure you'll eventually find one during your travels. When you do, bring it to me or one of the other Jestmasters, and we'll see where that takes us! Oh, and please have this, some light reading for your travels! Ta-ta!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn1.o3.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.c1>“Blessed be the Honkmother, it's you again! How's it going?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1>“I've retrieved the mask as you asked.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.c1>“I can see that! Congratulations! You can keep it—as you can see, I already have one. Or throw it away if you feel like it. It's just a mask, and a pretty ugly one, too, if you ask me.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1>“Why did you want me to get it then?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.c1>“The task itself was menial, wasn't it, like an unimaginative fetch quest in a children's role-playing game? But did you have fun while looking for it? I'm sure you ran into all sorts of trouble along the way, and I'm sure it was quite an adventure, something you even enjoyed at times. I bet you wouldn't have become a submariner if you didn't! So, perhaps I should ask you instead why you wanted to get it—or for that matter, why you want to keep cruising around Europa doing all sorts of tasks for people.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1>“I suppose I do enjoy the adventure, but what does this have to do with the path of the bike horn?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Fun and games, fun and games! I chose a quest in a game as the analogy for a reason: When you go a bit further than that, all social institutions are games. And if you really get to the bottom of things, the whole world is a system of games: There's the people game, the crawler game, the game of bilging the hatches, stowing the afts and all those submariner things you do…”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Okay…?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“But be careful of the word 'game'! It doesn't mean this is all meaningless. It's like we're playing a song: It's not that serious, but at the same time it can be very sincere. It can take all sorts of beautiful forms in all their complexity, for no reason at all beyond just doing them. Like this!” The Jestmaster honks his bike horn in your face.</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“I think I get what you mean. So, what's next?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Ooh boy, this one is going to be something! First of all, I want you to get yourself a toy hammer. You know, one of those silly plastic toys that go 'honk' when you smack someone with it.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“And then…?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Then comes the fun part: I want you to dive down into the abyss and meet one of those big fellas that live down there. A Latcher would do, but if you can find yourself a Charybdis or an Endworm, that'd be at least thrice the fun. Then, I want you to bop it with the hammer, and I want you to bop it good!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“That doesn't sound smart, but I trust there's some kind of a point to this.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“That's the spirit! It's not smart in the slightest, but sometimes you're better off ignoring that sensical part of your noggin and just enjoying the ride on the rollercoaster the Grandest of Jesters has laid out for you. Anyhow, let me or one of my colleagues know when the deed is done. And take this along, some more reading for your travels! Good luck! I wish you an exciting and hopefully not-too-lethal ride!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>“What the hell? Are you trying to get me killed?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>“I presume you don't see the silliness, nor the profoundness of that question yet, which is precisely why you need to do it if you wish to walk further down this path. There's nothing more I can tell you at this point, but let me or one of my colleagues know when the deed is done! And take this along, some more reading for your travels! Good luck, and remember to have fun!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>“This pseudophilosophical crap is making my brain hurt. Could you just tell me what the Honkmother is about?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>“I see you are very capable of not taking certain things seriously! If only you could direct that lack of giving a crawler's ass into something more fruitful… And yes, I can tell you the Honkmother is three pounds of custard pie, but that doesn't mean anything to you, does it? I didn't think so. Thus, you need more training—let's try another task!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>“Sure.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.c2>“Is this an invisible version of the mask, perhaps? I would actually like to see it.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o1.c2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o2>“Still haven't found the Mother's Countenance. Any tips?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o2.c1>“These masks have been out of fashion for a long time, but perhaps if you found a wreck old enough, you might get lucky. And, of course, this is the traditional garment of the Jestmasters, so with a bit of outside-the-box thinking you might find another path forwards. Wink wink!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o2.o1>“Did you just say 'wink wink'?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn2.o2.o1>
<EventText.toyhammeronabyssmonster.c1>The toy hammer bops the abyssal beast, but nothing happens. You wonder what the point of all this was, until you realize it might be better to dismiss those thoughts for now and focus on making it out of here alive.</EventText.toyhammeronabyssmonster.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.c0>“Hey, I could use your opinion on something. Hypothetically, if one was building a Honkmotherian exosuit, would it be too on-the-nose to call it the 'HONK Mech'?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.c0>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o0>“Uhh, why're you asking?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o0>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.c1>“Actually, never mind, it's nothing important! Let's get to business instead: A little bird told me you've been on a quest of sorts. How did the meeting with the abyss monster go?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1>“How the hell do you think it went? I barely made it out alive.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.c1>“I was sure you would, but I take it that you weren't quite as confident? It seems you still have some ways to go before you get to truly taste the custard pie. I want you to think about it. What is it you feared would happen—and what are you still afraid of? Had you gotten swallowed by that abyss thing, do you really think that would've silenced your bike horn for good, been the end of your story? Who is this 'you' you're afraid of losing?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o1>“Had I not escaped its jaws, it most definitely would've been the end of my story.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o1.c1>“Would it, really? That's a matter of perspective; if you insist that this role you're playing right now, these eyes through which the universe or whatever you wish to call it is looking at itself, is the whole extent of the story, then sure, that would've been a morbidly amusing end to 'your' story.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o1.o1>“I'm not sure what you mean.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o2>“I have no idea what you're trying to say.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o1.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2>“I found it amusing, but the monster didn't seem to get the joke.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.c1>“Haha! The honk of your horn is getting more vibrant by the day. But do tell me, did this close encounter with death, or perhaps even a brief dip into death, make anything new rustle inside that noggin of yours?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1>“I'm not sure what you mean.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.c1>“We're getting into the territory where words fall short, but I'll give it a try. When we're inside the circus tent watching the performance, we don't think or talk about the world outside—we just immerse ourselves in the show. And that's good! Just enjoy the show without distracting yourself with the fact that at the end of the night, you'll be stepping out of the tent.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1>“Is this an allegory for afterlife?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.c1>“Not any more than it is an allegory for 'beforebirth', whatever that means. Let me put it this way: think about what your original face looked like before you were born. Or, before you put on this mask. And after you've stepped out of the tent, are you completely sure that you won't be coming back some other day? You did enter the tent once, or perhaps even several times, so who's to say it can never happen again?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o1>“You're talking about some kind of reincarnation now?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“As I said, this is something where the words of this world fall short. I can't spell it out in any more detail, but the bottom line is that death is a jest. Who is this 'you' you're afraid of losing, and can you really lose it? That could be a nice homework for you to ponder on until we meet again! Ta-ta!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o2>“I know what you're talking about, but let's keep the masks on and stick to our roles for now!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o2.c1>“By the Honkmother! I suppose you have indeed taken a peek or two outside the tent already. Or perhaps we should say, you're taking a peek into the tent right now? At any rate, I'm impressed at your progress. I think I'm going to need some time to figure out what our next step should be, so let's wrap this up for now. Until we meet again!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o3>“I know what you're talking about. There is nothing after my death, but it's no more scary than the nothingness before my birth.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o3>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o3.c1>“I suppose that's one way of looking at it, but I'm afraid that's a huge banana peel you've just stepped on! You've completely misunderstood what I've been trying to get across. Let me put it this way: Think about what your original face looked like before you were born. Or, before you put on this mask. You know what, that could be a nice homework for you to ponder on until we meet again! Ta-ta!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn3.o2.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.c1>“I’m happy to run into you once again! In fact, the timing couldn’t have been better. We’ve been looking for a volunteer for a mission of sorts.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1>“We’re interested.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.c1>“After seeing how you fared with that abyss beast, I think you’ve proven yourself as someone with enough guts, or perhaps a healthy amount of carelessness, to pull this thing off. You remember that Honkmotherian exosuit I mentioned a while back?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1>“I do. What about it?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.c1>“We’ll get to that in a bit! You see, there happens to be an outpost nearby that used to be a safe haven of sorts for those who heed the call of the bike horn. An independent outpost where we could live a peaceful and quiet life, figuratively speaking. That hasn’t been the case in a long time though, nor is it anywhere on Europa nowadays, as I’m sure you know. Not a week goes by without news of a jester being beaten up or found dead in a ballast or what have you.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1>“I know. So, what is it you’re planning?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.c1>“We’re going to make ourselves a safe haven again! Now, we’re at a stalemate, with the outpost having seemingly become the property of the serious folks for good, our jolly people unable to do anything about it despite our best efforts. As if there was some rule that once you take an outpost, the owner is set in stone. So we’re going to have to bend the rules of the game a little! That’s where that exosuit comes in.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1>“You’ve actually built one?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Yes, we have! We don’t want to play as dirty as they do, but I believe we can do this without resorting to violence. We’re going to give that outpost such a bombardment of Fun, nuclear-powered bike horns blaring and banana peel cannons turning the place into an obstacle course, day and night for however long as it takes, until they have no choice but to give up and find themselves a more ‘serious’ place to stay.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“You believe they won’t stop us by force?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“They might try, of course. But Funbringer 3000 should be able to take a shot or two. Or maybe a few dozen. I hope! Which brings me to my next point: I believe with the amount of combat expertise you and your crew must have, not to mention your apparent disregard for your own safety, I think you’re the best ones for the job. Hence, we’d be eternally grateful if you were the ones to wear the suit and help us regain control of that outpost.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“We’d be happy to help you.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Oh, marvelous! I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist. However this goes, I think you’re going to have plenty of fun. Here's the suit. I've marked the location of the outpost on your map.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>“We need to think about this a bit.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Have you thought about our proposal? Would you be willing to wear Funbringer 3000 and help us regain control of that outpost?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>“We’d be happy to help you.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>“We need to think about this a bit.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o2>“We don’t have time for this right now.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn4.o2>
<EventText.clownhaven1.c1>You've arrived at the outpost the Jestmaster told you about. Equip the Funbringer 3000 and bombard the outpost with Fun until the more serious inhabitants realize this is better left for the Children of the Honkmother!</EventText.clownhaven1.c1>
<EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c1>People seem to be mightily annoyed by the Funbringer. Perhaps this will work!</EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c1>
<EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c2>Distant sounds of bike horns echo from somewhere in the outpost, followed by a joyful holler: “Praise the Honkmother!”</EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c2>
<EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c3>One of the outpost dwellers yells at you. “Take that thing out of here or I'll call the security!”</EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c3>
<EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c4>An announcement comes over the PA. “To all security personnel: Shut that fucking clown machine down by any means necessary. Use of deadly force is authorized...no, encouraged.”</EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c4>
<EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c5>Another announcement comes over the PA. “Okay, we give up. This ain't worth it. Have your goddamn outpost, just please shut that thing down.”</EventText.clownhaven1.c1.c5>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1>“Oh, oh, it’s you! You did it! Honestly, this was such a ridiculous plan I’m mildly surprised how well it worked! I don’t know how we could thank you enough, but the least we can do is let you keep the suit. Perhaps you’ll find some more use for it on your voyages.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1>“Thanks!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.c1>“I have to say, it is impressive how far you've made it on the path of the bike horn in such a short time. For many, the path is much longer, and some fail to find it at all.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1>“So, what’s next?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.c1>“I'm both happy and sad to say that this is as far as I can take you; the rest of the path you're going to have to walk by yourself. But I can also see that you already know the direction.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1>“This was it? You’re not going to tell me what the Honkmother is?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Oh, silly you. What would you want to hear? That she’s the Fun flowing through our veins or the friends we made along the way? Three pounds of custard pie, perhaps? Or the monkey-god riding on a great turtle, the framework holding up this world around us? Those are all fun little words, but just like before, this is a topic where words fall short.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1.o1>“…”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“To try to explain it in words would be as if I were explaining a joke, and well, it would just fall flat. Such is the Grand Joke of the Universe, too, beyond words, and one must not confuse the world of things as we name them with the world as it actually is.”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1.c1>The Jestmaster looks at you inquisitively.</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1.c1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1.o1>“Is there really no more advice you can give us?”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1.o1>
<EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1.o1.c1>“I have a hunch where your path is going to eventually take you. When you get there, you will understand the rules of this game of life even more clearly than you do now. When all is laid bare before one's eyes, some may opt to stop playing along altogether, perhaps choosing a life of asceticism or stepping out of the tent completely. And that's fine! You're going to have to let the credits roll at some point. Others, like me and my Jestmaster colleagues, choose to keep playing our part, to keep the Fun going and to help others understand the nature of this game. That's a fine choice too! Whichever path you end up taking, I wish you lots of luck and amusement in your journey. Praise the Honkmother!”</EventText.pathofthebikehorn5.c1.o1.c1>

<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1>The outpost manager pulls out a document from his breast pocket, and looks at you with a contemplative expression. “Hmm… This particular mission was commissioned by Victoria Petran herself, and it's quite sensitive, but I suppose you've proven you're someone we can trust.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.whosthat>“Who's that?”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.whosthat>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.whospetran>“Wait, what? You've been working with us this long, and you’ve never heard of her? She’s the First Lieutenant of the Jovian Separatists. Essentially our leader, if one can consider a group as loosely organized as us having a leader.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.whospetran>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.o1.o1>“Ah, I see. So, what’s the mission?”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.o1.o1>
<EventText.missionevent.pleasecontinue>“We're interested. Please continue.”’</EventText.missionevent.pleasecontinue>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.c1>“You have heard of the Tormsdale incident, haven’t you?”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1>“That rings a bell, but please do elaborate.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.c1>“Okay, I guess I’ll start from the beginning. Back when the Coalition was starting to gain a foothold on Europa, Tormsdale was by far the largest independent colony, and the Jovian People’s Movement obviously had strong support there. I suppose it was in a sense considered the headquarters of the independent colonies and the Movement. At that time, Europa was still somewhat democratic, and the general elections were coming up.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1>“Mm-hmm.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.c1>“Just a few weeks before the elections, there was a nuclear disaster in Tormsdale. Over a hundred people dead. And conveniently for the Coalition, almost all of them happened to be supporters of the Jovian People’s Movement. That was enough to tip the scales in their favor, and let them become the de jure government of Europa.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1>“That sounds a little too convenient to be a coincidence.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Indeed. It was officially deemed an accident, but I find that very hard to believe. From there, things went south fast—the Movement was declared a terrorist organization, our founder Harlow Petran assassinated, most of the independent outposts taken over…”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Right. How does this tie in with the mission?”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“We have reason to believe the Coalition still possesses some classified reports of what actually happened at Tormsdale. Our informants have strong evidence that copies of them are kept in a nearby outpost. If we got our hands on them, maybe we could finally prove this isn’t just a conspiracy theory, and get others to understand how dirty the Coalition has been playing ever since its early years.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“We’d be glad to help.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Great. I’ll mark the outpost on your map. According to our intel, the documents are stored in a secure cabinet in the outpost manager’s office. Getting them out might be tricky—perhaps you could try to coerce the outpost manager or steal their ID card. Either way, please try to be discreet.”</EventText.missionevent_tormsdalereport.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.c1>This must be the outpost manager. You need to figure out a way to get their ID card to gain access to the secure cabinet.</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o1>“Hello. We’re doing a Coalition-mandated security inspection and need to examine the secure cabinet in your office. Would you mind opening it for me?”</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o1.c1>“Uhh… What? How stupid do you think I am? Get the fuck out of my office before I call security.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o1.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o2>“Revolution is near. Give us your ID card or you’re dead.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o2>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o2.c1>The man immediately pulls out his gun.</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o2.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o3>“Excuse me, sir! There’s some kind of a dispute a few decks down, and I was told to come get you.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o3>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o3.c1>“I see. Show me the way!”</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o3.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o3.c1.c1>“I don't know if you're trying to mess with me or what, but I need to get back to work. Goodbye.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o3.c1.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o4>Ignore him and keep walking.</EventText.tormsdalereport_outpost.o4>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.c1>“Hello! I hear you’ve been commissioned to find us certain important documents. What’s the status?”</EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o1>“I found the documents.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o1.c1>The outpost manager takes the papers and glances through them, eyes widened. “Oh, oh! This is huge! If these are authentic, there’s no question the Coalition mass-murdered everyone in Tormsdale. When these go out, it’s going to be a huge blow to them. I can’t thank you enough for this. I’ll put in a good word to Lt. Petran and make sure she knows it was your crew who accomplished this. I’m also going to pay you for your troubles, of course.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o1.c1>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o1.c2>“Well, please bring them over! I can't wait to see what's in them.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o1.c2>
<EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o2>“I don’t have the documents right now.”</EventText.tormsdalereport_complete.o2>

<eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.c1>“As you may be aware, this outpost is the last stop before the Europan Ridge. We don't let every sub pass through here, but if there's any truth to the rumors we've been hearing about your crew, you've been a valuable ally in our fight against the Coalition, so you're more than welcome to pass.”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.c1>
<eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.c2>“Looking to pass through the outpost to the deeper regions? I'm sorry, but you'd better find another route. I don't know who you are or who you're working for, and for all I know you could be another Coalition pawn heading to harass our people down in the Europan Ridge. Of course, if you happened to have some marks to share with me, perhaps you could convince me of your good intentions…”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.c2>
<eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.o1.c1>“On second thought, you seem all right. Perhaps I'll let you pass after all. Pleasure doing business with you.”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.o1.c1>
<eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.o2.c1>“Your choice. Maybe it's better for you to play in the kiddie pool a little longer and figure out whose flag is worth carrying.”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.o2.c1>
<eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.o1.nomoney>“Not enough cash? Well, tough luck. Maybe you should play in the kiddie pool a little longer to prove us you're not standing in the enemy's ranks.”</eventtext.unlockpathcoldcavernsseparatists.o1.nomoney>
<eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridgeseparatists.c1>“It says here you've been a great asset in our fight against the Coalition here in the Ridge. For that, we've decided to grant you access to the Aphotic Plateau. Bon voyage!”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridgeseparatists.c1>
<eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateauseparatists.c1>“I'll have to congratulate you. Not many make it through the Plateau, much less while being so useful. I'll radio ahead to let you move to the Great Sea.”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateauseparatists.c1>
<eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateauseparatists.o1.c1>“I'm sure it will. That is not an official guarantee by the Jovian Separatists nor an endorsement. I'll let the guard know you can take care of yourself.”</eventtext.unlockpathaphoticplateauseparatists.o1.c1>
<eventtext.unlockpathgreatseaseparatists.c1>“So you want to enter the Hydrothermal Wastes? Why on Europa would you do such a thing? I suppose it's none of my business. A friend of the Separatists is a friend of mine. Go ahead.”</eventtext.unlockpathgreatseaseparatists.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1.o1>Take the money and promise to keep your mouth shut.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1.o1>

<EventText.jailbreak.c1>“Oh, thank god. We thought we'd never be getting out of here!”</EventText.jailbreak.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_separatists.c1>The outpost manager seems to hesitate a bit. “This mission might be on the more challenging side, but judging by your reputation, you may be able to pull it off.”</EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_separatists.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_separatists.o1.c1>“A couple of our operatives were recently captured by the Coalition, and according to our informants, they're currently locked away in an outpost nearby. If you can get them out of there safely, we'll be sure to make it worth your while. I'll mark the location on your map.”</EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_separatists.o1.c1>

<EventText.jailbreak_alarm.c1>An announcement comes over the PA. “To all security personnel: code red. We've got some fugitives on the run.”</EventText.jailbreak_alarm.c1>
<EventText.jailbreak_sootman.c1>“Hey. I presume you were sent here by Lt. Petran?”</EventText.jailbreak_sootman.c1>

<EventText.jailbreak_sootman.o1.c1>“Yeah, I figured. Thanks. And I presume you've got a boat ready?”</EventText.jailbreak_sootman.o1.c1>
<EventText.jailbreak_sootman.o1.o1>“Yes, follow me!”</EventText.jailbreak_sootman.o1.o1>
<EventText.jailbreak_sootman.o1.o1.c1>“Actually, I've got a couple of bones to pick before we leave. Let's meet on board that boat of yours in five minutes.” The man darts off before you manage to say anything.</EventText.jailbreak_sootman.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1>The outpost manager pulls out a document from his breast pocket. “This is one of those extra-sensitive missions, if you know what I mean. A commission from Lt. Petran. In fact, she hoped to assign this specifically to your crew.”</EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1.c1>“The Coalition managed to capture one of our operatives recently. A very high-profile one, although luckily it seems they're not aware of his identity—otherwise he'd surely have been executed already.”</EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1.c1>
<EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1.o1>“Who is it?”</EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1.o1>
<EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1.o1.c1>“Perhaps it's better we leave him unnamed, but let's say it's someone who's left quite a trail of smoldering Coalition outposts and vessels behind him. In any case, he is currently being held captive in a nearby outpost. Get him out safely, and there'll be a sizeable reward waiting for you.”</EventText.missionevent_jailbreak_sootman.c1.o1.c1>
