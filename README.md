# Barotrauma-zht-edited

### [ENG](./README_eng.md)
This is a Traditional Chinese localization mod for the game Barotrauma, based on the official ones. Their lines are matched as close as possible with the game's current version English text files for easier side-by-side comparison.

Do use it at your own risk, as I couldn't guarantee any of the translations were as accurate as possible whatsoever, but feel free to edit it on your own. And always back up your edited files.

### I have something to report
Head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/nokau/Barotrauma.zht.edited.mod/issues) page, click on the green `New issue` button, then click the `Get started` button on the right side of the 2 issue types. And since this is a Traditional Chinese localization, please send your issues in Traditional Chinese.

### I want to contribute
I'm not familiar with GitHub or all its intended functions, to be honest, so if you're interested in doing so, I guess you could make separate versions of the project instead of changing the base version of the files.

### [中文](./README_zht.md)
這是一個基於官方繁體中文、參考官方英文進行調整的繁體中文文本Mod。文本檔案內容盡量以當前版本的官方英文文本檔案內容進行排序，以便對照。

還請斟酌使用，我無法保證這個文本中用語與詞彙的精確度等等，但歡迎在使用時自行對它進行編輯，編輯後也勿忘備份。

### 我有問題想要回報
可以至 [Issues](https://github.com/nokau/Barotrauma.zht.edited.mod/issues) 頁面，點選右方綠色的 `New issue` 按鈕後，點選新頁面中位於2個對應主題其中一項右方的綠色 `Get started` 按鈕。

### 我想直接貢獻心力
我對GitHub這方面的功能並不熟悉，所以如果想要直接對專案內容進行修改的話，請建立額外版本並請避免直接修改原始檔案。
